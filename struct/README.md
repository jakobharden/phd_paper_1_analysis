## Dataset Exporter, version 1.1:

*Dataset Exporter* is implemented in the programming language of *GNU Octave 6.2.0* and allows for exporting data from binary datasets. The main features of that script collection cover the export of substructures to variables and the serialization to the CSV format, the JSON structure format and LaTeX code. It is also made publicly available under the *MIT* licence in the repository of *Graz University of Technology*.
